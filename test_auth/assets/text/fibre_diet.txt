Eating plenty of fiber is beneficial for gut health and weight management. It may also help prevent diabetes.

Studies in people with prediabetes and older women with obesity show that this nutrient helps keep blood sugar and insulin levels low.

Fiber can be divided into two broad categories: soluble, which absorbs water, and insoluble, which doesnâ€™t.

Soluble fiber and water form a gel in your digestive tract that slows down food absorption, leading to a more gradual rise in blood sugar. Thus, eating more soluble fiber may reduce fasting blood sugar and insulin levels.

Insoluble fiber has also been linked to reductions in blood sugar levels 

While many studies on fiber and diabetes use fiber supplements instead of high fiber foods, getting more fiber from foods is likely beneficial.

SUMMARY
Eating a source of fiber at each meal may help prevent spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, which may reduce your risk of diabetes.
