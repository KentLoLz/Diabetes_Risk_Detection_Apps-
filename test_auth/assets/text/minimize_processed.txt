Lowering your intake of heavily processed foods benefits several aspects of health.

Many foods undergo some form of processing. Thus, processed foods, which include plain yogurt and frozen vegetables, arenâ€™t inherently unhealthy.

Yet, highly processed foods have undergone significantly more processing and often contain added sugars, unhealthy fats, and chemical preservatives. Examples include hot dogs, chips, frozen desserts, sodas, and candy bars.

Observational research associates diets high in ultra-processed foods with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.

Conversely, cutting back on packaged foods that are high in vegetable oils, refined grains, and additives may help reduce your risk of diabetes.

This may be partly due to the anti-diabetes effects of whole foods like nuts, vegetables, and fruits. One study found that diets high in processed foods increased diabetes risk by 30% but that eating nutritious whole foods reduce this risk.

SUMMARY
Minimizing your intake of highly processed foods and focusing on whole foods may help decrease your risk of diabetes.
