Carrying extra weight may increase your risk of type 2 diabetes.

In particular, visceral fat — excess weight in your midsection and around your abdominal organs — is associated with insulin resistance, inflammation, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes.

Notably, losing even a small amount of weight — as little as 5–7% — may help lower your risk of type 2 diabetes if you have prediabetes, overweight, or obesity.

A randomized, 2-year study in more than 1,000 people at increased risk of type 2 diabetes showed that exercise, diet, and weight loss interventions significantly reduced the risk of this disease by 40% to 47%, compared with a control group.

Many healthy weight loss strategies exist. Preparing a balanced plate with non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, complex carbs, and healthy fats is a great place to start.

SUMMARY
Modest weight loss may significantly reduce your risk of diabetes, particularly if you have excess abdominal weight.
