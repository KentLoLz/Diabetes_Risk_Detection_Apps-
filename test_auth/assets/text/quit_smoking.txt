Smoking has been shown to cause or contribute to many serious health conditions, including heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung and intestinal cancers.

Research also links smoking to type 2 diabetes. While the mechanisms aren’t fully understood, it’s thought that smoking may increase insulin resistance and inhibit insulin secretion.

Plus, heavy, more frequent smoking is linked to a higher risk of diabetes than smoking fewer cigarettes.

Importantly, studies suggest that quitting smoking may reduce diabetes risk.

One large study in more than 53,000 Japanese adults found that diabetes risk in those who smoke decreases over time after quitting. Smoking cessation for 10 or more years may even decrease this risk to about the same level as those who never smoked.

SUMMARY
Smoking, especially heavy smoking, is strongly linked to diabetes risk. Quitting has been shown to reduce this risk over time.
