Sticking with water as your drink of choice will help you limit beverages that are high in sugar.

Sugary beverages like soda and sweetened fruit juice have been linked to an increased risk of both type 2 diabetes and latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA).

One large observational study in 2,800 people found that those who drank more than 2 servings of sugary beverages per day had a 99% and 20% increased risk of LADA and type 2 diabetes, respectively.

In addition, one review found that 1 serving of sugar-sweetened drinks per day may increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes by 18%.

In contrast, increased water intake may lead to better blood sugar management and insulin response.

One 24-week study showed that adults with overweight who replaced diet sodas with water while following a weight loss program experienced a decrease in insulin resistance, fasting blood sugar, and insulin levels.

SUMMARY
Drinking water instead of sugary beverages may help manage blood sugar and insulin levels, thereby reducing your risk of diabetes.
