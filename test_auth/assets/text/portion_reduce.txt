Eating portion sizes appropriate for your needs may also help prevent diabetes.

Eating too much food at one time has been shown to cause higher blood sugar and insulin levels in people at risk of diabetes.

Conversely, eating smaller portions may lead to reduced calorie intake and subsequent weight loss, which may in turn lower your risk of diabetes.

While there are few studies on the effects of portion management in people with prediabetes, research in those with type 2 diabetes offers some insight.

A study in adults with overweight or obesity, including some with type 2 diabetes, found that following a meal plan with portion-managed meal replacements and appropriate portions of other healthy foods led to weight loss and reductions in body fat.

What’s more, guidelines for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes support portion management as a way to help individuals maintain a healthy weight.

To manage your portion sizes, make your plate half non-starchy vegetables, a quarter lean protein, and a quarter complex carbs like fruit or whole grains. If you’re at a restaurant that serves large portions, choose an appetizer for your main course or ask for a half portion.

Plus, instead of eating snacks straight out of the bag, place your desired amount into a separate dish.

SUMMARY
Avoiding large portion sizes may help reduce insulin and blood sugar levels, promote weight loss, and decrease your risk of diabetes.
