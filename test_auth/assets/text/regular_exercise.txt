Doing physical activity regularly may help prevent diabetes.

People with prediabetes often have reduced insulin sensitivity, also known as insulin resistance. In this state, your pancreas has to make more insulin to get sugar out of your blood and into cells 

Exercise increases the insulin sensitivity of your cells, meaning that you need less insulin to manage your blood sugar levels 

Many types of physical activity have been shown to reduce insulin resistance and blood sugar in adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. These include aerobic exercise, high intensity interval training (HIIT), and strength training 

One study in 29 people with type 2 diabetes found that HIIT, which involves bursts of intense activity followed by brief recoveries, led to improved blood sugar management and longer sessions of endurance training.

However, you don’t need to do HIIT to reap benefits. Short exercise bouts that last as little as 10 minutes, such as brisk walking, are great options. If you’re just beginning an exercise routine, start with short workouts and work up to 150 minutes per week.

SUMMARY
Exercising regularly may increase insulin sensitivity, which may in turn help prevent diabetes.
