Vitamin D is important for blood sugar management.

Indeed, studies link vitamin D deficiency to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

Some studies also show that vitamin D supplements may improve many aspects of blood sugar management in people with prediabetes, compared with control groups.

However, current research is mixed on whether vitamin D supplements prevent the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes.

Still, maintaining adequate vitamin D levels is important for your health, especially if youâ€™re deficient. Good food sources include fatty fish and cod liver oil. In addition, sun exposure can increase vitamin D levels.

For some people, supplementing with vitamin D daily may be necessary to achieve and maintain optimal levels. Speak with a doctor to get your vitamin D levels checked before starting a supplement.

SUMMARY
Eating foods high in vitamin D or taking supplements may help optimize vitamin D levels, which may help reduce your risk of diabetes.
