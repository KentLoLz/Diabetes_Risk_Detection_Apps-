Cause

-Type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Polyuria is often one of the first signs of diabetes. The condition makes sugar build up in your bloodstream. If your kidneys aren’t able to filter it out, it exits your body in your urine. As the extra sugar and fluids travel through your kidneys, you have to pee more. Plus, the more you go, the thirstier you feel, and the more you’ll drink

Symptoms

Besides making a lot of pee, you might also:
-Feel thirsty. You're losing a lot of fluid, and that can lead to dehydration.
-Wake up often at night. Your urge to go doesn't stop when you sleep. 

Treatment

-If you have diabetes that isn’t under control, you may need to make changes to your treatments.
-If a medicine you take is the cause, talk to your doctor about switching to another drug or changing your dose. 
-At home, cut back on how much fluid you drink, especially those that have alcohol and caffeine.
