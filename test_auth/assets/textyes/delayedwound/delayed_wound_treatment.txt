People with diabetes can use specific strategies to improve the time it takes for a wound to heal. These include managing blood glucose, thorough foot care, and treating wounds as they occur.

[Foot care for diabetes]
-washing feet daily
-patting the skin dry before applying moisturizer
-avoiding walking barefoot
-carefully trimming toenails
-wearing comfortable shoes
-inspecting feet and looking inside shoes daily
-having a doctor check the feet at each visit

[Wound treatment]
-It might be a good idea for people with diabetes to wear shoes and socks when walking around, especially if a wound has developed. Being barefoot increases the risk of infection.

-People who have any type of diabetes should seek treatment if a wound develops on their foot and does not heal. A person will often need to take antibiotics to combat any infections and might require hospitalization if the wound is severe.
