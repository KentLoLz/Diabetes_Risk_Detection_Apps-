[Topical medication]
Minoxidil (Rogaine) is a popular over-the-counter treatment for hair loss. A person applies the medication directly to the areas of the body where hair loss has occurred.

[Lifestyle Changes]
Although exercise may not prevent or reverse hair loss, it can help the body maintain good blood circulation. Regular exercise can help increase blood flow to different parts of the body, including the hair follicles and the upper and lower extremities. It can also help a person control their blood sugar levels.
