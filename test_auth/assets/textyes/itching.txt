Cause 

-The cause of diabetes-related itching is diabetic polyneuropathy or peripheral neuropathy. These are complications of diabetes that develop when high blood glucose levels cause damage to nerve fibers, particularly those in the feet and hands.Before nerve damage starts to occur for people with diabetes, high levels of cytokines circulate the body. 

-These are inflammatory substances that can lead to itching.

Symptoms

-A person has peripheral neuropathy, they are more likely to experience itching on the lower parts of the legs. They may also experience a loss of sensation, usually in the feet or hands. A tingling sensation might accompany these symptoms.

-People with specific skin conditions or infections will itch at the site of the spot or lesion. Itching can make a person feel uncomfortable in their clothes, wake them up in the night, and make them feel as if they always need to scratch.

Treatment

-Managing diabetes carefully and preventing blood sugar levels from becoming too high.

-Avoiding taking very hot baths. Hot water can remove moisture from the skin.

-Applying skin lotion while the skin is still damp after a bath or shower. However, a person with diabetes should not apply lotion between the toes, as this can work with moisture to attract harmful fungi.

-Avoiding moisturizers that contain harsh perfumes or dyes. Look for a product whose label that states that the lotion is “gentle” or “hypoallergenic.” Some manufacturers create lotions specifically for people with diabetes.
