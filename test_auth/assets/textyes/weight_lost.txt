Cause 

-In people with diabetes, insufficient insulin prevents the body from getting glucose from the blood into the body’s cells to use as energy. When this occurs, the body starts burning fat and muscle for energy, causing a reduction in overall body weight.
Symptoms

-Unintentionally lost more than 5% of your normal body weight, or more than 10 lbs (4.5 kg) in 6 – 12 months or less

Treatment

-To manage weight loss with diabetes, you'll first need to get your blood sugar under control. You'll need to work together with your healthcare provider on a treatment plan toward this goal, which may involve different strategies depending on your disease.

-Diet, exercise, and other lifestyle changes work for some people with diabetes who aren't taking medication.Typically, once someone is treated for diabetes and their blood sugar normalizes, their weight loss will stabilize.
