Causes 

-People with uncontrolled diabetes may develop poor circulation. As circulation slows down, blood moves more slowly, which makes it more difficult for the body to deliver nutrients to wounds. As a result, the injuries heal slowly, or may not heal at all.

Symptoms

-Pain around the wound that doesn't improve or seems to get worse.
-Dark or blue color around the edges of the wound.
-Wound that seems to be weeping, draining or leaking more.
-Redness or swelling that spreads away from the wound.
-The wound starts to smell bad.

Treatment

People with diabetes can use specific strategies to improve the time it takes for a wound to heal. These include managing blood glucose, thorough foot care, and treating wounds as they occur.

[Foot care for diabetes]
-washing feet daily
-patting the skin dry before applying moisturizer
-avoiding walking barefoot
-carefully trimming toenails
-wearing comfortable shoes
-inspecting feet and looking inside shoes daily
-having a doctor check the feet at each visit

[Wound treatment]
-It might be a good idea for people with diabetes to wear shoes and socks when walking around, especially if a wound has developed. Being barefoot increases the risk of infection.
-People who have any type of diabetes should seek treatment if a wound develops on their foot and does not heal. A person will often need to take antibiotics to combat any infections and might require hospitalization if the wound is severe.
