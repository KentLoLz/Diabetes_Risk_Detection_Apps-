-Managing diabetes carefully and preventing blood sugar levels from becoming too high.

-Avoiding taking very hot baths. Hot water can remove moisture from the skin.

-Applying skin lotion while the skin is still damp after a bath or shower. However, a person with diabetes should not apply lotion between the toes, as this can work with moisture to attract harmful fungi.

-Avoiding moisturizers that contain harsh perfumes or dyes. Look for a product whose label that states that the lotion is “gentle” or “hypoallergenic.” Some manufacturers create lotions specifically for people with diabetes.
