Causes 

-Researchers think that over time, uncontrolled high blood sugar damages nerves and interferes with their ability to send signals, leading to diabetic neuropathy. High blood sugar also weakens the walls of the small blood vessels (capillaries) that supply the nerves with oxygen and nutrients.

Symptoms 

-Numbness or reduced ability to feel pain or temperature changes.
-Tingling or burning sensation.
-Increased sensitivity to touch â€” for some people, even a bedsheet's weight can be painful.
-Numbness or tingling in your hand or fingers, except your pinkie (little finger).
-Weakness in your hand that may cause you to drop things.

Treatment

-Slow progression of the disease
Keeping your blood pressure under control, maintaining a healthy weight and getting regular physical activity.

-Relieve pain
Anti-seizure drugs: Some medications used to treat seizure disorders (epilepsy) are also used to ease nerve pain.

Antidepressants: Some antidepressants ease nerve pain, even if you aren't depressed. Tricyclic antidepressants may help with mild to moderate nerve pain. Drugs in this class include amitriptyline, desipramine (Norpramin) and imipramine (Tofranil).
